# HR Data Warehousing Management System.

## Preamble. 
The trend of workforce management processes began during the 1970s. Due to limited technology and ​ mainframe 
computers​ , companies were still relying on manual entry to conduct employee evaluation and to digitize reporting. 
Now, HRMS technologies have allowed HR professionals to shy away from their traditional administrative work and 
have inserted them as strategic assets to the company. For example, these roles include employee development, as well 
as analyzing the workforce to target talent-rich areas. 

## Project Motivation.
The workforce is the basic element of any corporation that if correctly analyzed and managed accurately can lead to 
prosperity of this entity and revolutionary predictions that may save resources or achieve massive profits if analytics 
were accurate enough to read the future. 

## Problem Statement. 
The amount of data is massive and highly variant and distributed over many databases that are not connected or 
mapped in a clear way that helps extracting valuable information , in addition the scatter of this data makes it more 
difficult for hr employees to analyze them for certain purposes which waste unnecessary time and analysis might not be 
very accurate which might lead latter on to taking wrong decisions that would cost the corporation an unnecessary cost 
whether as using unneeded resources (recruiting , time consuming ,...) or waste of already existed resources ( an 
excellent employee skills unused or a project with high profit gets rejected for wrong predictions based on inaccurate 
analytics). 
This data must be gathered in a Data-Warehouse that connects all variant aspects of the corporation where it can be 
managed dynamically viewed, updated and analyzed applying data mining techniques with trusted predictions for 
better decision making and less HR employees.

## Project Aim & Objectives.
### Aim: 
We aim to build a human resources management system to collect all corporation data to one system which connects all 
variant aspects of the corporation to perform data mining and analysis. 

### Objectives: 
1- Employee self service​ : This module allows ​ employees to login to the system, view their personal data, view but not 
modify time sheets, attendance, and performance reports. 

2-​ Attendance :​ This module keeps track of dates and exact time of attending and leaving the office for any employee, 
also absence and permissions ... etc. 

3- Feedback : ​ Analyze the feedback data for skill ranks for every employee on each project as well as project success 
analysis based on employees feedback on projects they’ve worked on. 

4- Tasks` time tracking and scheduling :​ ​ Time tracking for tasks assigned to each employee including time duration , 
business weight of this task to serve performance analysis , ranking based on difficulty , skills needed​ . 

5- Talent Management : ​ This module uses the data available for the skills rating and progress of the workforce to 
assign tasks to the employees. 

6- Training module :​ This module recommends suitable training programs for employees based on their skill ranking. 

7- Performance Evaluation : ​ This module evaluates the performance of each employee based on several attributes: 
attendance, task completeness, time of completing the task, skill ranking and training taken. 

8- Predict Strength and Weakness Fields :​ This module defines the reason behind project failure based on data 
represented by project performance evaluation function. 

9-​ Recruitment : ​ This module analyzes the data of candidates from the cv pool and compares the given data with the 
already stored data of current and previous employees to determine most suitable candidates to fit or fulfill the shortage 
of specific skills needed.
